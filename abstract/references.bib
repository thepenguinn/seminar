abstract="Nowadays we are witnesses to the rapid expansion of smart cities and smart transportation services. Smart transportation services especially in the urban area can be different, but they have the same goal, to enhance the driver experiences in the urban area. Smart transportation services have constant growth. This growth is facilitated by the deployment of long-range wireless technologies such as LoRa and LoRaWAN. At the same time, the concepts of Edge computing shape the architecture and services of future smart city applications. This paper describes the implementation methodology of machine learning on the ESP-32 NodeMCU edge devices. The proposed methodology includes the implementation of classifiers such as Random Forrest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, Gradient Boost, and SVC with the scikit-learn library and Python. Scikit-learn-based models are pre-trained on PC and further processed with a micromlgen library to build an Arduino code for implementation on ESP32-based edge devices. The findings of this paper can be implemented in any smart transportation service where the prediction of wireless signal coverage for mobile users is important.",

abstract = {Maize, a vital global food crop, is susceptible to various diseases impacting agricultural yield and quality, necessitating effective monitoring strategies. This study presents a comprehensive approach utilizing advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for efficient maize leaf disease detection and classification. Leveraging datasets from Kaggle, Harvard Dataverse, and Mendeley, the proposed CNN maize disease detection (MDD) system integrates optimization techniques, data augmentation, batch size adjustments, and fine-tuning strategies. Evaluation through data splitting reveals significant correlations among maize leaf classifications and the influence of data augmentation on image quality. Following training, the CNN-MDD model is deployed on a Microcontroller Unit (MCU) simulation, achieving promising optimization parameters: latency of 7.60 ms, RAM size of 726.60 KB, classifier flash size of 344.70 KB, and an accuracy of 94.60 %. These optimized parameters align well with MCU specifications, highlighting the potential for practical deployment on low-cost edge devices like Arduino Ble 33 Sense. Additionally, this research contributes to the creation of a Ghanaian maize crop pest and disease dataset and the development of an optimal and cost-effective CNN-MDD MCU edge device, aiming to provide local farmers in Ghana and Sub-Saharan Africa with a swift, offline solution for maize disease detection, thus fostering sustainable agricultural practices. We conduct a comparative analysis of Edge Impulse and TensorFlow, two prominent machine-learning platforms for TinyML model development and deployment in various applications, including smart crop disease detection. Utilizing a dataset comprising 12,344 raw images and 7,454 augmented images of healthy and diseased maize leaves, we evaluate the workflow, features, performance, and usability of each platform. Our findings indicate that Edge Impulse holds a slight advantage over TensorFlow in terms of ease of use, reliability, and memory footprint, whereas TensorFlow offers greater flexibility, customization options, and higher accuracy. We conclude that while both platforms are suitable for crop disease detection, a combined approach allows for leveraging TensorFlow's robust training capabilities for complex neural networks alongside the simplicity of Edge Impulse for deploying models on low-powered edge devices. This synergistic approach enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of crop disease detection systems, ultimately benefiting agricultural practices and food security.}

abstract="The appearance of fruits and vegetables has a significant impact on their market value and consumer preference. Manual identification and sorting are time-consuming and costly. Many machine learning and deep learning models have been proposed in the past for fruit categorization which were deployed on GPUs. In this work, deep learning models for fruit classification are built on GPU and tested to be deployed on the ESP-32 microcontroller. This paper examines machine learning approaches based on CNN, Mobile net models for low cost and low power embedded devices to detect fruits and vegetables. Fruits 360 data set is used in this study where models are built to classify fruits into multi classes. The MobileNetV1 model fared well in distinguishing fruits and vegetables for 17 classes and achieved 94{\%} testing accuracy on a google colab (GPU) environment. The model was deployed onto the ESP32 Cam environment and tested for its performance. The accuracy in prediction classes by the model on ESP32 was 77{\%} with an inferencing speed of 51 ms and memory usage of 66.1 kb. Experimental results show that a low-cost ESP32 microcontroller can be deployed for agricultural product classification.",

abstract="Equipping the agricultural industry with state-of-the-art technologies such as big data analytics, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the most promising solutions to more efficient and sustainable yield production. In this context, we develop a tinyML-oriented model for a deep learning-based greenhouse microclimate management to be integrated into a on-field microcontroller. Multivariate climate data were collected from sensors installed inside a designed experimental strawberry greenhouse. The obtained values' combinations were labeled according to an eight-action control strategy, then used to prepare a balanced deep learning-ready dataset. The latter was used to train, cross-validate, and test 90 multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with varied hyperparameters to select the most performant and optimized model instance for the addressed task. The final selected model incorporates one hidden layer with 8 neurons and has just 104 parameters; it scored a mean accuracy of 95{\%} during the cross-validation phase and 94{\%} on our supplementary test set. The model enables active, robust, and autonomous greenhouse management with the less required computations. It can be efficiently deployed in microcontrollers within real-world operating conditions.",

abstract="Tiny Machine Learning (Tiny ML) is gaining popularity for deploying lightweight ML models on resource-constrained devices like microcontrollers. The main challenge lies in creating efficient models due to limited resources and a lack of standardized tools. The STM 32F platform, known for low power consumption and real-time processing, is ideal for low-latency applications. By developing Tiny ML Models on this platform, developers can enable real-time applications in areas like automotive, healthcare, and industrial automation. An innovative approach involves using TensorFlow Lite for model compression, fitting ML algorithms into microcontroller memory, and optimizing performance for edge computing applications, such as camera-based object detection. This STM 32F-based model aims to demonstrate an end-to-end Tiny ML product development flow by enhancing the efficiency of standardized templates in terms of computation and memory requirements. In order to choose memory-efficient model designs and meet computing and memory requirements, data preprocessing, quantization, loop unrolling, and memory management must be optimized while weighing the trade-off between accuracy and resource consumption.",

This success has led to the possibility of using CV on ever smaller computing devices, giving rise to the research area TinyML, which enables ML tasks on, e.g. resource-constrained microcontrollers. On this basis, we extend the scope of TinyML and present an image regression task where a self-generated dataset is introduced. We compare eight different approaches with different CNN architectures and normalization methods, with the best performing model achieving an MAE of 0.54 on an ESP-32. Furthermore, the ML models used are compared in terms of their performance when used on an ESP32 and on a PC. Finally, we present open questions and further research directions based on our results.}
