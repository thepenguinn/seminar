    %% Say about TinyML

    TinyML is a subset of machine learning (ML) that focuses on developing and deploying
    ML models on resource-constrained devices such as Microcontrollers (MCUs), System-on-Chip
    (SoCs) and other such devices. Frameworks such as TensorFlow Lite Micro, and Arm CMSIS-NN
    are used for developing ML models for low powered devices. Techniques used in TinyML
    enables these devices to be more efficient at running ML models. Thereby improving
    decision-making, reducing cost and power consumption.

    %% Say about seminar

    This seminar aims to explore recent trends and advancements in TinyML, specifically in its role in the
    Agriculture sector. TinyML enables low powered devices such as ESP32 CAM modules, STM32
    microcontrollers, and Arduinos to be used in ML applications. These devices can then
    perform growth monitoring, plant disease detection, and mirco-climate management in
    place of expensive Raspberry Pis and other Mini PCs. Thus, TinyML powered low power
    edge devices may find applications in smart agriculture in isolated places and also where
    low power consumption is at top priority.

\section*{Background}
\label{sec:background}

    TinyML is a subset of machine learning (ML) that focuses on developing and deploying
    ML models on resource-constrained devices such as Microcontrollers (MCUs), System-on-Chip
    (SoCs) and other such devices. TinyML consists of techniques, and design methodologies
    that improve the efficiency of ML models. This is achieved through \emph{model compression},
    and making use of \emph{efficient algorithms} and \emph{hardware accelerators}.
    Model compression can be achieved via techniques like \emph{pruning}, \emph{quantization},
    and \emph{knowledge distillation}. Use of \emph{optimized ML algorithms} for low-power, low-memory devices
    and utilizing \emph{hardware accelerators} can also help in speeding up the computation.
    The design flow is depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:designFlow}.

% Microstrip patch antennas offer advantages such as light weight, compact size, planar configuration,  ease of fabrication and compatibility with PCB technology \cite{iftissane2011conception}. Various geometries of radiating patch elements such as square, circle, and rectangle have been considered in the previous studies\cite{gupta2013circularly}. However,  microstrip patch antennas generally have narrow bandwidth, low efficiency  due to dielectric and conductor losses and disability to operate at high power levels of waveguide \cite{zhang2016design}\cite{harish20153}\cite{vaishnavi2014simulation}\cite{anand2015analysis}.  The design approach is depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:design}.

A real time environmental monitoring system driven by a TinyML model using Graph Neural Network (GNN) optimized with Q learning was proposed\cite{ieee00gnn}
and the system was proven to be better than conventional monitoring systems.
A system based on TinyML for plant disease detection was implemented in the remote areas within West Africa\cite{ieee01africa}. The
study compared the TinyML based system to a cloud based one and found that the TinyML based one had promising performance as
there is no need for internet connectivity.

% A pentagonal patch antenna with loaded open loop resonator (OLR) for enhancing the gain and reducing cross-polarization compared to \cite{lafmajani2011miniaturized}\cite{gupta2019design} is proposed. The intended application of the proposed antenna is a technology for providing internet connectivity to fishermen in deep sea using long range Wi-Fi communications \cite{rao2016realizing}\cite{jayakrishnan2018effect}. The specifications of the antenna required for this application are compact size, high gain for providing required connectivity from shore. Directional antennas providing high gain will enable us to achieve high signal to noise ratio such that connectivity in the order of tens of kilometer can be established. Antenna array solutions, on the other hand, although enhances the gain, but will consume large area and hence not suitable for this application. In the proposed antenna configuration, an inset-fed pentagonal microstrip antenna is taken as the parent structure and performance characteristics are studied. The size of the proposed antenna configuration is much less as compared to conventional antennas of similar gain \cite{joshi2011metamaterial}.
