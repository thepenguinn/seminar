\section{TinyML} \label{sec:}

TinyML is a subset of machine learning that focuses on developing and
deploying ML models on resource constrained devices. TinyML was coined
by \emph{Pete Warden} co-author of the \emph{TinyML} book and one of the
founding members of Google TensorFlow team.

TinyML possesses great advantages and some drawbacks. In the following
chapters we will explore some of these. After a quick tour of the TinyML
workflow, we will move to its applications.
