\section{Doing More} \label{sec:}

But what if they could do more? What if they could use a much more wider
range of this available data? For that we need to make these tiny devices
able to process different kinds of data. Some types of data are a bit tricker
to be comprehended by these tiny devices. Complex data such as \emph{images} fall
into such categories.

This seminar aims to explore how these tiny minds can become able to comprehend
such complex data through a new technology called TinyML and how those new
capabilities can further provide viable solutions to different problems arising in
the \emph{Agriculture sector}.
