\section{Drawbacks of Advanced ML Models} \label{sec:}

But all of these comes at a cost. The requirement of powerful
hardware to run these models. In most cases it would require a whole
data center worth of computational power to run a single instance of
the model. This makes edge computing really expensive and non feasible.
This forces edge systems to offload other data to remote systems for
processing. That comes with its own kind of problems.

\subsection{Major concerns}

The larger and more complex the ML model is, the higher its hardware
requirements will be. This leads to expensive hardware. These powerful machines
consume a large amount of power to run, which increases the carbon footprint.
On the other hand, in most cases, cloud computing solutions provide a viable
alternative, but they raise other concerns like privacy and latency.
