\section{What They Did} \label{sec:}

In this study\cite{microclimate}, researchers developed an optimized tinyML-oriented
model for an active machine learning based greenhouse microclimate management system
to be integrated in an on-field microcontroller. Inorder to collect multivariate climate data,
they designed and deployed an experimental strawberry greenhouse.
Then the dataset is used to train and five-fold cross-validate 90 Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLPs)
with varied hyperparameters and selected the most performant yet optimized model instance for the addressed task.
Figure \ref{fig:case2Pic} shows the experimental greenhouse.
