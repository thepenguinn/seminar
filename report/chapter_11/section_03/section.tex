\section{Results They Got} \label{sec:}

From their 90 model instances, they selected a model incorporated 2 hidden
layers with 7 and 8 neurons respectively and 151 parameters, and it scored a
mean accuracy of 97\% during the cross-validation phase, then 96\% on the
supplementary test set. Thanks to the TinyML approach the developed model
was a light weight one. So it can be effectively deployed on microcontrollers
within real world operating conditions.
