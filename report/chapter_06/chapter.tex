\chapter{Conclusion} \label{chp:}

% Around six million years ago hominids left their homes in woodlands and
% ventured into the vast open fields of savannah. Non of them really know what
% that would lead to. But I'm pretty sure that their heart felt a new beginning
% upon looking at the uncut fields. The species had seen such beginnings many
% times. One of such beginnings happened far later, in the 60s as personal
% computers becoming a thing.  No one knew what was coming. But those who owned a
% personal computer were excited. Now look around, we are surrounded by
% computers. TinyML is still in its infancy. Only future will tell where TinyML
% would lead us.

TinyML provides a way to bring ML to low power edge devices. This enables ML to
be used in a plethora of embedded applications. And paves a way for the
widespread adoption of edge computing. As we have seen, Agricultural Sector could
greatly benefit from TinyML, as it encourages to use ML in \emph{remote} and
\emph{resource constrained} systems in an \emph{economically viable} manner.

TinyML is still in its early stages, with ongoing experimentation and
exploration of its full potential. As research and development continue,
advancements in techniques and tools will make TinyML increasingly powerful,
efficient, and suitable for a wide range of real-world applications. With
continued research and innovation, TinyML is set to become even more accessible
and impactful in the years to come, enabling smarter and more connected systems
at the edge.
