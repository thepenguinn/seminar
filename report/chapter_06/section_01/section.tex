\section{``Ok Google'' ML Model} \label{sec:}

In 2014, engineers at Google had to solve a peculiar problem. They
wanted the Android phones to be able to wake from sleep mode just using
``Ok Google'' wake word(s). In order for this to work, these Android
phone needs to continuously process the audio signal from its surroundings
and look for the wake words. But unfortunately this can't be carried
out by the main CPU, obviously, as it will be in the sleep mode for
conserving battery.

So they had to turn to the embedded DSPs in these devices, that only had
\emph{tens of kilo-bytes} of memory and \emph{really low} processing power.
In short, they had to develop an ML model that will look for the wake words
that would fit into the constrains of these tiny DSPs. They in turn, succeeded
in this and developed a neural network that does this heavy lifting that sized under
just \emph{14 kilo-bytes}. And those DSPs only used few milli-watts of power
while running.
