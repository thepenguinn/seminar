\section{Drawbacks of Advanced ML Models} \label{sec:}

But all of these comes at a cost. The requirement of powerful
hardware to run these models. In most cases it would require a whole
data center worth of computational power to run a single instance of
the model. This makes edge computing really expensive and non feasible.
This forces edge systems to offload other data to remote systems for
processing. That comes with its own kind of problems.

\subsection{Major concerns:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Need for expensive hardware.
    \item Increased carbon footprint.
    \item Security and privacy issues with cloud computing.
    \item Latency related with cloud computing.
\end{itemize}
