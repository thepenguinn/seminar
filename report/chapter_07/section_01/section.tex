\section{Low Fidelity Nature} \label{sec:}

The con of a sword is that it's sharp. Just like that, TinyML's
greatest advantage is it's greatest disadvantage. It is essential
to compress the size of the model to fit with the constrains of the
host device. In this process the model could turn into a \emph{low fidelity}
one.

But in most cases this will be fine, as the low fidelity one can
still infer useful information from the surroundings. Another useful
technique to increase the performance of the overall system is to
\emph{cascade} the low fidelity one with a high fidelity one.


% Just as TinyML has it advantages, it has its disadvantages.
