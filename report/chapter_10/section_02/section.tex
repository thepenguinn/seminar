\section{What They Did} \label{sec:}

In this study\cite{ieee01africa}, researchers from Ghana develop a TinyML base plant
disease detection system based on ESP32 CAM. This was aimed to help the farmers
in Ghana to detect \emph{Brown Streak} and \emph{Mosaic} diseases in the
Cassava\footnote{Which is a common crop in West Africa.} plant. They held a comparative
study against the already available cloud based solution. Figure \ref{fig:case1Pic}
shows a farmer in Berekuso using the TinyML system.
