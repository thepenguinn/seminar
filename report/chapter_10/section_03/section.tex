\section{Results They Got} \label{sec:}

The TinyML based system gave a \emph{promising performance} even though the
cloud based Plantix\footnote{Name of the app.} was better in terms of \emph{accuracy}.
But on an \emph{economic bases}, TinyML based system was \emph{more feasible} than the
cloud based one because inorder for the farmers to use the Plantix app they need to
afford a smartphone. Comparing to that the ESP32 based one was much cheaper.
