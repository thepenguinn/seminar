\section{Privacy and Security} \label{sec:}

The most \emph{secure} connection is \emph{no connection} at all. Since the
ML model is running on the device itself, there is no need to sent anything
over the wire or air. That is the beauty of \emph{edge computing}, everything
stays locally on the device itself. From the privacy and security point of
view this is really desirable.
