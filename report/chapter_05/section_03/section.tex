\section{Economic Viability} \label{sec:}

Modern day's microcontrollers are \emph{extremely cheap}. And they are
literally used everywhere. So giving them additional capabilities is
much more preferable than replacing them with something that is powerful
but expensive. Refer table \ref{tbl:priceMicrocontrollers} to get
an idea about the market price of some of the popular microcontrollers.

From table \ref{tbl:priceMicrocontrollers} we can see that the average price
of these microcontrollers is around 500 INR. At the same time the cheapest
SBC\footnote{Single Board Computer} costs about 1500 INR. That's just for
the board itself. Inorder to run the device one needs to get other
accessories\footnote{Namely, SD card, power supply, etc.}.
