\section{Low Power Consumption} \label{sec:}

These tiny devices have advanced much more in the aspect of energy conservation.
They can do much more with much less power consumption. Take a look at table
\ref{tbl:powerMicrocontrollers}, it gives an idea about the current consumption
of some of the microcontrollers.

Comparing to a Raspberry Pi 4, this is really low. Pi 4 consumes about $1.5\si{A}$
of current while running. It is possible to configure these microcontrollers in
their respective power saving mode to bring down the current consumption even less.
ESP32 has a ULP\footnote{Ultra Low Power.} co-processor that can do various tasks
while the main CPU is sleeping for conserving power.
